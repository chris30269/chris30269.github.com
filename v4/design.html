      <h1 class="title is-size-3">Design Process</h1>
      <p>I have experience in the entire design process from design, through prototype/build, to evaluation. I have done several types of design and prototyping in different fidelities from paper sketches to interactive looks-like websites. <a onclick="document.getElementById('modal1').classList.add('is-active');">This sketch</a> of an internal site for customer service turned into this <a onclick="document.getElementById('modal2').classList.add('is-active');">interactive prototype</a> in Axure. After handing that over to the developers, I keep an eye on everything and make sure there were no miscommunications. To evaluate, I've used mixpanel to get analytics about usage without having to engage users directly. I've also used a variety of user research methodologies to directly work with users to inform any improvements we could implement.</p>

      <h1 class="title is-size-3">Pills4U</h1>
      <p>In this class project, I designed an interface for an embedded device and accompanying mobile app for senior citizens and their caregivers to manage the complex scheduling of medicines and pills.The mobile app is intended mostly for the caregivers (family, friends, and medical staff) and the device is for the patient. I started with some sketches and diagrams for the mobile app (<a target="_blank" href="images/ID%206515%20A%20-%20Fall%202014%20-%20Assignment%201%20-%20Ernst.pdf">mockups</a>, <a href="Assignment%202/index.html" target="_blank">clickable mockups</a>) and <a target="_blank" href="images/flow%203.pdf">the device</a>.</p><br>
      <p>On the device, the patient can see when their next dose is, and what it is. It automatically dispenses the correct dosage and gives visual and audio alerts. The device's interface uses large fonts and buttons, and high contrast visuals so that mobility- and visually-impaired patients can still use it easily.</p><br>
      <p>It has a VoIP system so it can make calls directly from the device. These calls may be initiated by the patient, who may have questions or concerns, or by the system itself if the patient is not taking their medications. It associates doctors with medications and people with their relationship to the patient, so the patient does not need to remember names.</p>

      <p>This board game (<a target="_blank" href="images/game.pdf">sketch</a>, <a target="_blank" href="images/IMG_6624.JPG">final</a>) uses <a target="_blank" href="images/IMG_6625.JPG">RFID</a> to detect when players <a target="_blank" href="images/IMG_6627.JPG">get on</a> the <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/C0zJSRX.gifv">merry-go-round</a>. As a Super Smash-style melee, players lose and gain coins, so if they have enough for the fare, the motor spins and where she stops, nobody knows! Players use the <a target="_blank" href="images/Screenshot%202016-03-01%2015.04.40.png">Processing sketch</a> to roll the dice and steal each other's coins.</p>

      <h1 class="title is-size-3">Club Management Website</h1>
      <p>This website started as a project for databases systems (CS 4400), but became real. Homemade in MySQL, PHP, and JS, it's a member- and event-management system for the Glee Club. As a fairly casual club, members didn't always remember everything they needed to know: <a href="images/Screen%20Shot%202016-03-08%20at%205.26.25%20PM.png" target="_blank">sheet music</a>, <a href="images/Screen%20Shot%202016-03-08%20at%205.18.28%20PM.png" target="_blank">event details</a>, <a href="images/Screen%20Shot%202016-03-08%20at%205.17.47%20PM.png" target="_blank">attendance</a>, <a href="images/Screen%20Shot%202016-03-08%20at%205.19.28%20PM.png" target="_blank">carpools</a>, <a href="images/Screen%20Shot%202016-03-08%20at%205.17.37%20PM.png" target="_blank">contact info</a>, etc. This site has facilitated communication and made everyone's lives much, MUCH easier and more convenient.</p><br>
      <p>As class projects tend to do, by the end we just had to get it finished so a lot of the "design" was just a temporary fix that never got changed. I'm currently working on redesigning this project with a developer friend using Vue and Bulma.</p>
