					<h1>Design Process</h1>
					<p>I have experience in the entire design process from design, through prototype/build, to evaluation. I have done several types of design and prototyping in different fidelities from paper sketches to interactive looks-like websites. <a href="images/sketch1.JPG" target="_blank">This sketch</a> of an internal site for customer service turned into this <a href="images/axure2.png" target="_blank">interactive prototype</a> in Axure. After handing that over to the developers, I keep an eye on everything and make sure there were no miscommunications. To evaluate, I've used mixpanel to get analytics about usage without having to engage users directly. I've also used a variety of user research methodologies to directly work with users to inform any improvements we could implement.</p>

					<h1>Information Architecture</h1>
					<p>I'm a big believer in information architecture. I love organizing data and thinking about abstractions. A clear taxonomy is an important part of the user experience, which sometimes gets overlooked or becomes bloated. I like to use stickies (of course) <a href="images/stickies1.JPG" target="_blank">to map out the high-level structure</a> of a product. I also use card sorts, <a href="images/similarity matrix.png" target="_blank">similarity matrices</a>, and <a href="images/dendogram.png" target="_blank">dendrograms</a> to help with this.</p>

					<h1>User Research</h1>
					<p>I have used qualitative and quantitative methods to evaluate and iterate on many kinds of designs, from interfaces to physical devices. From guerrilla-type research a la "Don't Make Me Think," to more formal studies using tools like UserTesting.com, I use a variety of methods and tool to evaluate different facets of a product. I have extracted quantitative data from qualitative interviews and surveys, and conducted surveys and questionnaires.</p>

					<h1>Loyalty Program Management</h1>
					<p>Fanfare is one of the projects I work on at Elavon. It is a web SaaS application to help businesses attract and retain customers with discounts and offers. I am currently redesgigning the entire platform. This is mainly a desktop website, but will soon be on an integrated device (a payment terminal/card swiper). You can see the current state of the prototype <a href="https://7q1ebw.axshare.com/#g=1&p=main_page&c=1" target="_blank">here</a>. This is a work in progress and I'm working on it daily. <a href="images/fanfare research results 1.png" target="_blank">These</a> are the results of the legacy design I took over. <a href="images/fanfare research results 2.png" target="_blank">These</a> are the results of my redesign as of April. You can see the time to complete the tasks is down, the completion rates are up, and the ease of one task went up while another went down. I'm now using these results to improve my redesign.</p>

					<h1>Masters Project</h1>
					<p>My masters project collects data automatically about usage and performance to measure its efficacy. This is a custom-designed and -implemented solution specifically and only tailored to this project. Data is automatically collected and analyzed with the most up-to-date statistics available <a href="https://tonalrecall.gatech.edu/stats.html">here using d3 charts</a> (be patient, it's 14 MB of data and might take a full minute to load). This project involved submitting a formal research proposal and getting approval from the IRB.</p>

					<h1>Migraine Relief</h1>
					<p>This research project was over the course of a semester and involved real users and data. In order to alleviate pain caused by migraines, we investigated the ways people manage their pain and what they would like to have to help them do that. This involved submitting a formal research proposal and getting approval from the IRB.</p>
					<p>You can see the final summary poster <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6TydeLhZRgZVlNMeW9vMGFVMU0" target="_blank">here</a> and read the final report <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6TydeLhZRgZZERoM3R6V1BfcnM"></a>here.</p>

					<h1>Website Accessibility</h1>
					<p>I have used <a href="https://www.techsmith.com/morae.html">Morae</a> to evaluate and test websites with real users, especially those with various disabilities.</p>

					<p>I identified accessibility issues with the project I took over at Elavon. Text did not have enough contrast, and screenreaders were not taken into consideration in the markup. I started an internal guide for designers and developers to implement the low-hanging accessibility fruit.</p>

					<h1>Pills4U</h1>
					<p>This project is a typical example of 1 cycle of design, build, evaluate. In this class project, I designed an interface for an embedded device and accompanying mobile app for senior citizens and their caregivers to manage the complex scheduling of medicines and pills. The mobile app (<a target="_blank" href="images/ID%206515%20A%20-%20Fall%202014%20-%20Assignment%201%20-%20Ernst.pdf">mockups</a>, <a href="Assignment%202/index.html" target="_blank">Axure prototype</a>) is intended mostly for the caregivers (family, friends, and medical staff) and <a target="_blank" href="images/flow%203.pdf">the device</a> is for the patient.</p>
					<p>On the device, the patient can see when their next dose is, and what it is. It automatically dispenses the correct dosage and gives visual and audio alerts. The device's interface uses large fonts and buttons, and high contrast visuals so that mobility- and visually-impaired patients can still use it easily. See a prototype <a target="_blank" href="html5-boilerplate-4.3.0/index.html">here</a>.</p>
					<p>It has a VoIP system so it can make calls directly from the device. These calls may be initiated by the patient, who may have questions or concerns, or by the system itself if the patient is not taking their medications. It associates doctors with medications and people with their relationship to the patient, so the patient does not need to remember names.</p>

					<h1>Multi-modal Board Game</h1>
					<p>This board game (<a target="_blank" href="images/game.pdf">sketch</a>, <a target="_blank" href="images/IMG_6624.JPG">final</a>) uses <a target="_blank" href="images/IMG_6625.JPG">RFID</a> to detect when players <a target="_blank" href="images/IMG_6627.JPG">get on</a> the <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/C0zJSRX.gifv">merry-go-round</a>. As a Super Smash-style melee, players lose and gain coins, so if they have enough for the fare, the motor spins and where she stops, nobody knows! Players use the <a target="_blank" href="images/Screenshot%202016-03-01%2015.04.40.png">Processing sketch</a> to roll the dice and steal each other's coins.</p>
